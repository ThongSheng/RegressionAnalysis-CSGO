The analysis employs several regression models to assess which is most effective for this dataset, including:<br>
1. Logistic regression
2. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA)
3. Quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA)
4. Classification tree
5. Pruned classification tree. 

Details and results of analysis can be found in the "CSGO analysis report" pdf file.
