A simple analysis on the CSGO dataset that determines which predictors are useful in predicting which sides (Counter-Terrorists or Terrorists) will win the round. <br>
This project utilizes multiple regression models and determines which model is the most suitable for this dataset. <br>
Several examples of model used are:
1. Logistic regression
2. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA)
3. Quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA)
4. Classification tree
5. Pruned classification tree. 

Details and results of analysis can be found in the "CSGO analysis report" pdf file.
